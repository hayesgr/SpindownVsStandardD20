# SpindownVsStandardD20

The purpose of the file was to show that only in smaller sets of random selection there is any significant difference in the dice probability of a Spindown D20 vs a Standard D20 dice.
The more roles you do the closer the results look.
Even in the smaller sets the more sets of smaller sets you role you will find over time the accumilated sets will appear to match more and more.
This program simply demostrates the first of these.
